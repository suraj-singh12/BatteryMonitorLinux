1) Created Bash Script and the required audio file

2) Created the service then:
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/battery-check.service

3) Populated it in this format:

	[Unit]
	Description=Battery check script
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	ExecStart=/path/to/your/battery/check/script.sh
	Restart=always

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target


4) Then reloaded daemon
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload

5) Enabled the service
	sudo systemctl enable battery-check.service

6) Started the service
	sudo systemctl start battery-check.service


Note: If the above method of running as a service does not work, you can use this simple trick:

1) Open a terminal
2) write ./myBatteryMonitor.sh &
	This will get it running in the background and you can continue to work leaving the terminal as is.
